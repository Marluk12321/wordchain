# Longest word chain

Experiments to find a method to discover the longest possible chain of words using the following rules:
1. Only words in the given set may be used
2. No word may be used twice
3. Two words may be chained if the last two letters in the preceding word are the same as the two first letters in the following word

The problem is generalized as finding the longest path in a directed graph.
